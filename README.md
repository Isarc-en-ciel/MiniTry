# Doc minishell

#### This is extracted from the Bash manual 

The following is a brief description of the shellâ€™s operation when it reads and executes a command. Basically, the shell does the following:
1. Reads its input.
2. Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules described in [Quoting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Quoting). These tokens are separated by metacharacters.
3. Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands ([Shell Commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Commands)).
4. Performs the various shell expansions ([Shell Expansions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Expansions)), breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames ([Filename Expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Filename-Expansion)) and commands and arguments.
5. Performs any necessary redirections ([Redirections](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Redirections)) and removes the redirection operators and their operands from the argument list.
6. Executes the command ([Executing Commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Executing-Commands)).
7. Optionally waits for the command to complete and collects its exit status ([Exit Status](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Exit-Status)).


#### Grammar
#explanations bnf : 
"<...> : nonterminal, an abstract symbol that rpz a grammatical category (such as sentence, an instruction, an expression, etc)
variable ::= a | b | c : terminal : basic symbol's language. They cannot be subdivised (such as keywords, specific char, generally written as is in the rules)
definitions (productions rules) : defines how non-terminals can be transformed into terminals or into other non-terminals. ::= is equal to -> and means "is defined as"
ex : <expression> ::= <terme> "+" <expression> | <terme> : means that expression can be defined as terme followed by an "+" and other expression or simply as a terme
| : there is differents possible definitions 
recursivity : a nonterminals can be defined by itself"

### 1. Tokenization 
#### The tokenization consists to cut the string returned by readline() function into token (small pieces of substring). We identified x tokens types :
#### 1. PIPE (the char '|') 
#### 2. REDIRECTIONS (> , <, >>, <<) 
#### 3. QUOTES / D_QUOTES
